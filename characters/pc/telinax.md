## Background/Story:
Telinax is fond of stories however his own story doesn’t make for an interesting tale.  All he knows of his parents is that one of them was Elvish and the other was human.  Oh, and that they were not part of his life – and he doesn’t know why.

Telinax’s earliest memories were of an orphanage he was raised in.  He was singled out due to his elvish background.  The other children were not kind to him.  After a few years, he ran away from the orphanage to live on the streets of Keoland.  If the orphanage was described as hard, the streets were a form of hell built specifically for Telinax.  The less said about the streets is the better.  In short, Telinax would not have survived if not Madrigal.

Telinax met Madrigal the day he tried to pickpocket him.  Instead of a sharp cuff to the head, Madrigal gave him a piece of bread and asked of Telinax’s life.  Telinax did not want to share this – but it was the cost of the loaf of the bread.  After telling his story, Madrigal asked Telinax if he would like to travel with him and his troupe of performers and storytellers.  Although apprehensive, Telinax had no better prospects and decided to go with Madrigal – just for a short time…  Telinax would spend the next dozen years with Madrigal, learning the performer’s trade.

Madrigal also taught Telinax… alternative performance skills.  While picking a pocket could net you a few quick silvers, picking a lock to find the contents of a man’s letters could provide information as valuable as gold.  In time, Telinax was Madrigal’s apprentice in these alternative performances.  This arrangement allowed them to have fare fortunes for a time when combined with their regular performances.

One day Telinax was returning to the Inn where Madrigal was staying.  Madrigal’s door was left open – which was something he never did.  Telinax found Madrigal leaning against the wall in a pool of red.  He gasped and told Telinax to get out of Keoland and hide out.  He sagged and slumped and was no more.  In his hand appeared a brass ring that most certainly was not there previously.  Within the hour he was on the run again – gone was the home and life that Madrigal provided – he felt like the homeless urchin from all those years ago, alone in the city.
